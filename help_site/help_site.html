<h1>Telling Stories with Story Builder</h1>
<p>Story Builder lets you capture <em>moments</em> as you work with CODAP. You can put these moments together to tell a story to others about an investigation or even to <em>yourself</em> as a reminder of what you were thinking and doing.</p>
<h2>Quick Start</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Give the first moment a <em>title</em> by clicking inside it and editing the text to say "The start of my story" or whatever you like. When you're done editing press <em>return</em>.</li>
    <li>Notice how the text box below Story Builder <em>also</em> got this title. Edit the text inside it, the <em>narrative</em> to say something of your own about what you are going to do.</li>
    <li>If you don't already have some data, now would be a good time to drag some in. After you've done so notice that the moment gets a yellow background. This is to let you know you've made a change to the document that has not yet been saved as part of the moment.</li>
    <li>Click on the <em>plus</em> icon below the moment. A new moment appears. The changes you made are captured here.</li>
    <li>Click on moment 1. Notice that your changes disappear. Click on moment 2 and your changes reappear.</li>
</ul>
